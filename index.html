                    <p class="subtitle">PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)</p>
                    <p class="subtitle"><em>January 2023 to Present</em></p>
                    <p> As a Senior, I've been focused on executing major tech initiatives - from launching new products to managing $10M+ programs. I've built processes from the ground up for financial and resource management, developed business & technical requirements for enterprise systems, and handled everything from UAT testing to production support.<br><br> Some of my proudest moments came from solving problems nobody asked me to fix:<br><br>
                      <li>Our client needed to align a new acquisition with enterprise tech ops and cybersecurity standards but lacked implementation guidance. After spending weeks on discovery with app owners and security leads, I built an automated onboarding survey that triggered Jira workflows and assigned compliance tasks to the right teams. The client was so impressed they locked us in for their next acquisition integration, securing a $1M+ deal.</li>
                      <li>Our client's Quote-to-Cash implementation was losing customers due to a messy email-based escalation process. I took the initiative to build an automated intake system using PowerAutomate and Python that pinged relevant business and engineering teams via chat, tracked approvals, and maintained a prioritized backlog. The tool has processed 800+ escalations to date and helped retain $10M+ in at-risk recurring revenue.</li>

                    <p>As an associate, I dug into assessment work across Tech, Financial Services, and Telecom industries. Some key projects included: <br><br>
                      <li>A large creative technology company’s approach to “return to office” after covid, answering questions like “How do you enable employees to collaborate effectively when have the team is in office and the other half is working remotely?”, “How do we make the technology experience for team members returning to the office as easy as possible?”</li>
                      <li>A large payment processor’s approach to future proofing their employee onboarding and directory services whose growth strategy was inorganic, acquisition based (i.e. their tech stack was full of totally disparate unintegrated tech from prior acquisitions)</li>
                      <li>PwC’s approach to designing an outsourcing strategy for a massive financial services engagement that included talent from 4 continents, while optimizing for skillsets across geographies, ensuring compliance with client requirements, and ensuring profitability of the engagement.</li><br><br>
                      <strong>I was promoted in only a year and a half to senior associate!</strong>

                    <p>After graduating in fall 2020 and taking a 2-month siesta to snowboard all of the mountains on the IKON pass out west with friends, it looked like I wouldn’t have much on my plate for a few months prior to my August 2021 start date at PwC. Instead, I took the opportunity to learn and found a contractor / intern role at the advanced technology group at UPS as a Software Engineer. The 5 months I spent at ATG prior to joining PwC I was able to work on some awesome tech:     <br><br>
                      <li>I developed a PoC for a self-service package inventory iOS application that serves both location administrators and end customers using the OutSystems platform. The self-service UPS kiosk locations you see today began with that PoC!</li>
                      <li>I built a new system for tracking and maintaining reference to UPS’ patents! Julio, the stakeholder I was working with held 20+ patents of his own.</li>
                      <li>I was able to explore Waymo’s autonomous driving APIs and propose use cases to UPS R&D for an Autonomous Package Delivery Proof of Concept!</li>
